## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The idea for my web application "Flippy" is to create a plateform for people in local disc golf communities to buy, sell, and trade discs. A lost and found feature will also be included so that discs found on the local courses can be returned to their rightful owners. Disc golf players will find this usefull because it will centralize the used disc golf equipment marketplace.

Currently, aspects of this application exist on facebook groups. This application will create one location for the transfer of discs between players. I got the idea when I was on the St. Louis disc golf club facebook page. I noticed that many of the posts about discs that were for sale were being lost in the feed after a day or two. Also, when someone found a disc that wasn't theirs during a round, they would post about it on the page with little to no hope of ever returning that disc to the owner.

### Features
User Login: Users will be able to create a free account using a username and password.
Search: Users will be able to search for discs based on name, flight characteristics, color. For the lost and found discs they can search by course found at, color, name.
Map: Lost and found feature will show course maps and detail where discs where believed to be lost.
Post: Users will be able to post discs for sale including details and pictures.
Purchase: Users will be able to purchase discs using payPal.

### Technologies
Java
Springboot/Thymeleaf
MAMP database
Hibernate


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to create User sessions. I will also have to learn how to implement a Mapping API for the lost discs.
